	* suffix.dtx: Remove driver file here, it is in bigfoot.drv now.

	* bigfoot.dtx: new file with history from bigfoot.sty.

	* bigfoot.sty: removed.

2004-03-29  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.sty: Stop relying on \pp@label.

	* perpage.sty: New command \AddAbsoluteCounter, \pp@label and
	\pp@page are no longer exported, kerns are transported to after
	the whatsit to support [multiple]{footmisc}, per page resetting
	is done for each counter separately (doh!).

2004-03-25  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.sty (\MFL@mpreinsert): Add an appropriate \marks
	command after reinserting minipage material to make subordinate
	footnotes come out.

2004-03-22  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.sty: Rely on perpage.sty for a general sorted counter
	FN@totalid.
	Fix calculation of sort criterion.
	Adjust listdepth and itemdepth to zero within footnotes.
	Fix restoration of \reset@color and ilk.
	(\MFL@mpreinsert, \MFL@minipage, \MFL@removevboxes): restructure
	to deal better with recursive data structures.

2004-03-18  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.sty: Remove a significant space in \FN@magicglue
	calculation.
	In \FN@fnotecommon, move line size recordings to after
	\@makefntext had a chance to change them.

2004-03-16  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.sty: Use a penalty based model for evaluating total
	badness.  Basically helps to avoid lots of widows.

2004-03-14  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.sty: Declare compatibility options `para', `para*' and
	`ruled'.
	Allow for \@preparefnhtext to be predefined.
	Same for \@makefnvbox.
	Use suffix.sty for \FootnoteSpecific.
	Try rearranging Color tokens to allow for \normalcolor use.
	If placing color setup tokens, keep original depth of box.
