2006-09-05  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* perpage.dtx: Fix errors on first pass due to last change.

2006-08-25  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* perpage.dtx: Use `\def' instead of `\edef' in order to avoid
	problems.

2006-08-17  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* perpage.dtx: Try avoiding expansion at .aux readin time and use
	`\protected@edef' for some things.  This tries dealing with
	spanish.ldf.

2006-08-16  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: include `\maxdepth' in current box estimate of main
	vertical list.  Exclude current insertion depth from optimal split
	target.  Remove special treatment of main vertical list from
	`\FN@contribute@tw@', this was the wrong fix.

2006-08-13  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* README: Adapt to CTAN requirements and mope about them.

	* bigfoot.dtx: Fix wrong handling of `\clubpenalties'.  Make
	`\hfootfraction' and `vtypefraction' trigger a vertical block when
	either gets exceeded.  Increase the default of `vtypefraction'.
	Use `\vfuzz' in addition to `\vbadness' in a lot of places.
	Box255 can't be empty when reaching the output routine: remove
	dead code.  Try to avoid having signal penalties (when replaced by
	10000 by the output routine) remove valid breakpoints.  Let
	`\FN@getbreakpenalty' not truncate penalties to -10000.  Fix some
	trace messages.  Try to account for depth of main box material
	properly.  Probably not the last iteration, though.

2006-08-04  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* README: make the process of generating the docs more explicit.

2006-08-03  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* perpage.dtx: Try to replicate sentinel penalties.  Move `/style'
	goard to where it belongs.

2006-07-15  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* README: Adapt to perpage.dtx being available.

	* bigfoot.dtx: Unpack perpage as well.

	* suffix.dtx: Streamline header with rest of bigfoot.  Make
	self-sufficient compile.

	* perpage.dtx: created as source of perpage.sty

	* perpage.sty: removed because perpage.dtx exists.

2006-07-07  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Add `tracepage' option.  Try breaking to correct
	sizes.

2006-05-08  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Some comment changes.  Make a difference between
	compiling the file directly and the driver file.  Add
	`\FootnoteMainMinimum'.  Add more tracing.  Fix double output
	routine calls with special penalties resulting in lost page
	material.

2006-04-13  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* perpage.sty: Add some more doc, and `\theperpage' provision.

2006-03-25  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Make self-compile, and compile again.

2006-03-06  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Fix the default footnote definition/AtBeginDocument
	stuff.

2006-03-05  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Cater for useful slave id at start of document.

2006-03-05  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Lots of changes, change of algorithm.  Now we
	should have optimal breakpoints chosen (before there was an
	overfilling algorithm).

2006-01-08  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Use the right sign of gluestretch in
	`\FN@addmaterial'.

2006-01-05  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Change bookkeeping of splitdiscards in order to
	simplify the next batch of changes.  Optimization appears to be
	somewhat messed up, but there is no sense in fixing that before
	the next restructuring.

2005-11-04  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* perpage.sty: Don't set unused counter `pp@a@#1'.

	* bigfoot.dtx: Some rearrangements, try to maintain prevdepth
	instead of using struts when breaking through a list, try to
	properly account for that.

2005-10-24  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Cater for a bit more of void main page, set the
	minimum `\FN@bestebadness' at a different point.  Allow page
	breaks in footnotes.

2005-09-26  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Some changes across the board to make things work
	more reliably.  Start supporting void box255 (not yet complete).
	Add outputpenalty 13751 for unconditional iteration.  Refactor
	`\FN@restartoutput'.  Use `\FN@bestslaveid' (is this necessary?).
	`\topmarks' should now be correct in all cases.

2005-09-20  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Remove calculation of `\FN@lowestslave'.  Change
	the marks mechanism to something that has a chance of actually
	working.  Recycle marks before recursing (this is not yet done
	completely).  Lots of small changes around the board to get the
	new marks stuff working.  Fix wrong accounting for premature
	insertions that don't belong to the current page (this currently
	is not optimized in speed).  Some other accounting fixes.
	Initialize `\FN@config' based on \topmarks (those are not correct
	yet in case a line gets moved to the next page).

2005-09-05  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Get version info from style file.
	Add description into version string.
	Move \normalcolor back into vertical mode in vboxes.  Don't start
	paragraph before `\@makefntext'.
	Steal standard counters and print form from the default
	definitions.

2005-07-15  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: A few typos fixed, moving around marks.
	Add compatibility macro `\NCC@makemark' for new manyfoot versions.

2005-07-13  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* perpage.sty (\c@schk@): when opening a new counter group, reset
	it at end of document for the sake of the label check.  Make a
	number of control sequences preamble-only.

	* bigfoot.dtx: Change the normal algorithms into unrestricted
	horizontal mode so that for most purposes we'll get proper
	widow/clubpenalties for line breaks forced by the formatting
	algorithms.

2005-06-28  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx (\FN@sweepmarks): do mark sweeping.
	(\FN@restartoutput): factor out.

2005-04-23  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx (\FN@clearcache): Remove bogus error message.
	Add p@footnote formatting.

2005-03-16  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Basically fix a few mismatched braces.

2005-03-14  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Lots of additional debug code too numerous to
	mention.  Move around order of insertions and reinserted page
	material, and start nested output routine in a fresh vbox.  Some
	changes with regard to the calculation of \FN@lowestslave: now
	only updated on successful shipout.  Make the various widow
	penalties and stuff work in vertical mode footnotes.

2005-03-11  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Add \ftflags tracing, remove \iffoottrace again.
	When using the trace option, unknown options are interpreted as
	added flags to track certain trace features.  Add lots of tracing
	output and document some more stuff.  Also try working
	\cmd{\FN@splitcolors} correctly.

2005-03-09  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Add trace version of \FN@slotget that checks we are
	not using already freed versions.  New penalties
	\footnotewidowpenalty, \footnoteclubpenalty and
	\finalfootnotewidowpenalty.
	Various debug output additions.
	Remove \Footnotemark \Footnotetext and \Footnote redefinitions:
	those cause infinite loops.

2004-11-12  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.dtx: Still more reorganization and documentation.

2004-11-09  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* README: Adapt to the sty->dtx move for bigfoot itself.

	* suffix.dtx: Remove driver file here, it is in bigfoot.drv now.
	Simplify banner creation.

	* bigfoot.dtx: new file with history from bigfoot.sty.

	* bigfoot.sty: removed.

2004-03-29  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.sty: Stop relying on \pp@label.

	* perpage.sty: New command \AddAbsoluteCounter, \pp@label and
	\pp@page are no longer exported, kerns are transported to after
	the whatsit to support [multiple]{footmisc}, per page resetting
	is done for each counter separately (doh!).

2004-03-25  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.sty (\MFL@mpreinsert): Add an appropriate \marks
	command after reinserting minipage material to make subordinate
	footnotes come out.

2004-03-22  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.sty: Rely on perpage.sty for a general sorted counter
	FN@totalid.
	Fix calculation of sort criterion.
	Adjust listdepth and itemdepth to zero within footnotes.
	Fix restoration of \reset@color and ilk.
	(\MFL@mpreinsert, \MFL@minipage, \MFL@removevboxes): restructure
	to deal better with recursive data structures.

2004-03-18  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.sty: Remove a significant space in \FN@magicglue
	calculation.
	In \FN@fnotecommon, move line size recordings to after
	\@makefntext had a chance to change them.

2004-03-16  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.sty: Use a penalty based model for evaluating total
	badness.  Basically helps to avoid lots of widows.

2004-03-14  David Kastrup  <dak@gnu.org>

	* bigfoot.sty: Declare compatibility options `para', `para*' and
	`ruled'.
	Allow for \@preparefnhtext to be predefined.
	Same for \@makefnvbox.
	Use suffix.sty for \FootnoteSpecific.
	Try rearranging Color tokens to allow for \normalcolor use.
	If placing color setup tokens, keep original depth of box.
